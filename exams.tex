\question{A thee-phase commit protocol has the following parts \\
  \textbf{Phase 1:} is the same as the two phase commit.\\
  \textbf{Phase 2:} the coordinator collects the votes and makes a
  decision; if it is No, it aborts and informs participants hat voted
  Yes, if the decision is Yes, it sends a precommit request to all
  participants. Participants that voted Yes wait for a precommit or
  doAbort request. They acknowledge precommit requests and carry out
  doAbort requests. \\
  \textbf{Phase 3:} the coordinator collects the acknowledgements When
  all are received, it commits and sends a do commit to the
  participants. Participants wait for a doCommit request. When it
  arrives they Commit. \\
  Explain how this protocol avoids delay to participants during their
  ``uncertain'' period due to the failure of the coordinator or other
  participants. Assume that communication does not fail.}

\question[a)]{Eric wants to build a replicated storage system. In his
  system there is only one client. The client performs just one
  storage operation (read or write) at a time, waiting for each
  operation to complete before starting the next. Eric wants
  availability even in the case of one server failure. Because of that
  he decides to store the data on two servers. Eric wants to ensure
  that the data on the two servers stay identical all the time. In
  order to guarantee that he is thinking making the two servers atomic
  using three-phase commit, to ensure both-or-nothing behavior. In the
  design he has in mind, the client acts as the transaction
  coordinator. The client would execute a write as described in the
  three-phase commit protocol. The system uses timeout recovery scheme
  explaineed in the lectures. Eric thinks about this design for a
  while, and eventually realizes that three-phase commit is
  fundamentally not suited to providing availability via
  replication. \\
  Please explain why. Eric wants to formalize the consistency
  properties of the replication system. Is it sequential consistent?
  Is it a linearizable one? Please explain your answer.}
\question[b)]{Eric decides to change his design and uses now the gossip
  architecture that lazily synchronizes the two servers. The single
  client contacts any server that is available and gets the value that
  this server has, updates are also performed on the first available
  server first and then lazily propagated on the next server. Each
  client request uses a unique id.\\
  What is the availability that he can achieve? Eric wants to
  formalize the consistency properties of the replication system in
  case where there are no failures. Is it sequential consistent? Is it
  a linearizable one? Please explain your answer.}
\question[c)]{Eric decides to change his design and uses now nine replicas
  and quorums to ensure strong consistency and availability. What are
  the constraints on the sizes of read and write quorums? What is the
  availability that he can achieve? Give an example of quorum
  processing involving a write, two reads, then a write. Eric wants

  Asynchronous and the Synchronous Doorway. \\ Describe them in

  algorithm going to give us a solution to the resource allocation
  problem (e.g. is it going to guarantee mutual exclusion and
  no-starvation)? Please provide a proof sketch or a
